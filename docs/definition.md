In Microsoft Project, tasks represent the individual pieces of work required to complete a project. Tasks can range from small, simple activities to large, complex deliverables. Effective task management ensures that your project stays on track, within scope, and on budget.
Each task has these properties: 

- Duration 
- Start and fend dates
- Dependencies
- Assigned resources
