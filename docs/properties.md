# Set task properties

## Step 4: Define durations

To specify duration for a task:

1. In the **Duration** column, specify how long each task will take.

**Example**: Enter "5d" for five days or "3h" for three hours. For tasks with uncertain durations, use "TBD" as a placeholder and update it later.
