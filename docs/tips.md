# Tips for better task management

**Break down large tasks:** Ensure tasks are granular enough to be manageable and trackable.

**Update regularly:** Update task progress regularly to reflect the current status.

**Monitor critical path:** Use the Critical Path Method (CPM) to focus on tasks that directly impact project deadlines.

**Communicate changes:** Notify stakeholders promptly about any task-related changes that may affect the overall project.

**Generate reports:** Use built-in reporting features to generate task summaries and share updates with your team.
